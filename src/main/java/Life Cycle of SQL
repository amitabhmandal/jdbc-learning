Life Cycle of SQL Execution

Statement Object
connection.createStatement();

By using Statement object we need to execute Query which are of 3 types
1. executeQuery  : Select operations
2. executeUpdate : Non Select operations(insert / update / delete)
3. execute       : Both select and non select operations

Database Engine will perform two operations
1. Compilation (Checking syntax)
2. Execution 
Once execution done then result will be send back in resultSet by using statement object

Compilation involes = Tokenization(Scanning) > Parsing(Query Tree) > Query Optimization(create optimized query) >


Types of Statement:
1. Simple Statement   : 
Problem with statement execution - Everytime query is executed then it will always compile
and then executed.
Hence compilation process is redundant.


2. Prepared Statement : 
3. Callable Statement :
