Two Objects (Java Applications and Database) [Source and destination]

PART - 1 
Translator [So that Java Applications can communicate Database]

To convert Java calls into Database calls and Database calls into Java calls. 
We require Driver software

PART - 2
To reach Java Applications and Database a connection is established[]
That is called the Connection. [network socket is required]

PART - 3 
To carry data from A and B vehicle is required. Hence we need to put the data into[]

To send our SQL queries to database and bring back results from database to Java applications
we must use Statement Object

PART - 4
In B someone will put the elements into the vehicle[]

The database engine will execute our SQL queries and place it inside an object called
ResultSet.

This ResultSet object will be placed inside the statement object and reach the Java application



PART - 5
AFter the elements have been added into B then it will be send back to A through the vehicle
[]

From the statement object the Java application can access the Result Set.
